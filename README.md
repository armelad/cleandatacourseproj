# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the following files:

**run_analysis.R** - the main file that contains scripts to perform the following transformations:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**README.md**  - this file.

**CodeBook.md** - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data 

**dataset1.cvs** - tidy dataset for the items 1-4 from above. Dataset is limited to 1000 records to save space. 

**dataset2.cvs** - tidy dataset for the task #5  from above.
